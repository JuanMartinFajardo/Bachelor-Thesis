This repository is dedicated to my Bachelor Thesis. It was done by me (Juan Martín Fajardo) during the year 2023/2024 at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, under the supervision of Guillermo Gallego Sánchez and Guillermo Sánchez Arellano. The project is on \vCech Cohomology and its purpose is to emphasize its importance both as a theoretical tool (as a sheaf cohomology theory) and a practical one (as a method to compute cohomology of actual spaces). I include a to make clear that for simplicial complexes this computation is algorithmic, and I leave it here in this very respository.
